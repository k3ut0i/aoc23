** TODO Day05
- [X] plots for each map
- [ ] how the seed ranges split in each map.

** Day08
I thought there will be multiple end points for each input. When I first saw this, it seemed a simple matter of multiplying the 6 periods for each of these disjoint components, but then I remembered that traversal is dependent on the input directions. So we can still have multiple period intervals for each input.
